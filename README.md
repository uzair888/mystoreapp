This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

==============================================

Setup from scratch:
Introduction
MyStoreApp is a mobile application built with React Native for managing store products. It integrates features such as navigation using React Navigation, state management using Redux Toolkit, database management using WatermelonDB, and backend interaction using Supabase SDK.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version >= 18)
npm or yarn package manager
Android Studio and Xcode for mobile development environments
Installation
Follow these steps to set up MyStoreApp:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyStoreApp.git
cd MyStoreApp
Install dependencies:

yarn install

# or

npm install
Link native dependencies (for React Native < 0.60):

npx react-native link
Set up WatermelonDB and Supabase:

Configure your Supabase credentials in your application.
Initialize WatermelonDB tables and schemas as per your application requirements.
Start Metro Bundler:

npx react-native start
Usage
To run MyStoreApp on Android or iOS devices/emulators:

For Android:

yarn android
